In order to prevent you from running down rabbit holes that are less important to us, try to prioritize the following:

## What is Important

Proper function – requirements met.
Well-constructed, easy-to-follow, commented code (especially comment hacks or workarounds made in the interest of expediency (i.e. // given more time I would prefer to wrap this in a blah blah blah pattern blah blah )).
Proper separation of concerns and best-practice coding patterns.
Defensive code that graciously handles unexpected edge cases.

## What is Less Important

Demonstrating technologies or techniques you are not already familiar with.
